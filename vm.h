/* A virtual machine that executes bytecode 
 *
 * The input to a vm is the compiler output `chunk`. In interpret(), the first
 * thing the VM does is call compile to get a chunk wrapped in an ObjClosure
 * object. The output of the VM is running code (!) along with about
 * InterpretResult for error notification.
 *
 * The VM uses the following tools to aid with interpretation:
 *
 * - a stack of Value's, which is the main workhorse for calculations
 *
 * - a table of global variables; the VM needs to keep track of how global
 *   variables' values change over time and to be able to look them up by name
 *
 * - a table of strings, which keeps track of not only string values, but also
 *   string names such as identifier (class/variable) names
 *
 * - a stack of CallFrames; a call frame is created once a function is invoked,
 *   and contains a pointer to the function, a return address, an instruction
 *   pointer, and a pointer for where the frame starts to aid with resolving
 *   local variables.
 *   o the closures in the call frames contain a list of Value pointers that
 *     point to captured values
 *   o when the VM is initialized, remember that it is in a `pretend main()` 
 *     function, so a dummy call frame is initialized as well.
 *   
 * - the head of the heap linked list, for garbage collection
 *
 * - a linked list of captured values that are considered `open`; the benefit
 *   of the VM maintaining a global list of captured values is to promote
 *   sharing of closure variables, for example when two functions close over 
 *   the same variable. For faster lookup, this array is sorted by the index of 
 *   the value. These pointers are maintained as a linked list for faster 
 *   insertion in the middle.
 *
 * During execution, its toolkit looks something like this:
 *
 *      OP_SOME_BYTECODE       index1 'operand1'
 * ip-> OP_OTHER_BYTECODE      index2
 *      OP_POP
 *      OP_PUSH                index3 'operand2'
 *
 *      [ stack_val ][ <fn some_fn> ][ stack_val2 ][ stack_val3 ]
 *                  ^^                                          ^^
 *                 start                                     stacktop
